            <h2>The Responsible Computing Angle</h2>
            <p>This project is rooted in the principle of responsible computing. As our reliance on technology grows, so does its environmental footprint. By actively measuring and analyzing the energy consumption of our own campus labs, we aim to not only identify areas for improvement but also to foster a culture of environmental awareness among students and faculty. We believe that understanding our impact is the first step toward reducing it.</p>

            <h2>Our Methodology</h2>
            <p>We use a network of smart plugs and power monitoring sensors connected to lab computers, monitors, and peripherals. This hardware continuously sends power usage data (in Watts) to a central server. Our backend software then aggregates this data, calculates total energy consumption (in kWh), and estimates the associated carbon footprint based on the local energy grid's carbon intensity factor. This data is then visualized on our public dashboard.</p>
